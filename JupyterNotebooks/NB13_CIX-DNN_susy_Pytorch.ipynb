    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to introduce the powerful PyTorch framework for building neural networks and use it to analyze the SUSY dataset. After this notebook, the reader should understand the mechanics of PyTorch and how to construct DNNs using this package. In addition, the reader is encouraged to explore the GPU backend available in Pytorch on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this notebook, we use Deep Neural Networks to classify the supersymmetry dataset, first introduced by Baldi et al. in [Nature Communication (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5308). The SUSY data set consists of 5,000,000 Monte-Carlo samples of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric collisions with $18$ features. The signal process is the production of electrically-charged supersymmetric particles which decay to $W$ bosons and an electrically-neutral supersymmetric particle that is invisible to the detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first $8$ features are \"raw\" kinematic features that can be directly measured from collisions. The final $10$ features are \"hand constructed\" features that have been chosen using physical knowledge and are known to be important in distinguishing supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric collision events. More specifically, they are given by the column names below.\n",

    "In this notebook, we study this dataset using Pytorch."

    "## Structure of the Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing a Deep Neural Network to solve ML problems is a multiple-stage process. Quite generally, one can identify the key steps as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***step 1:*** Load and process the data\n",
    "* ***step 2:*** Define the model and its architecture\n",
    "* ***step 3:*** Choose the optimizer and the cost function\n",
    "* ***step 4:*** Train the model \n",
    "* ***step 5:*** Evaluate the model performance on the *unseen* test data\n",
    "* ***step 6:*** Modify the hyperparameters to optimize performance for the specific data set\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we sometimes combine some of these steps together for convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we take a rather different approach, compared to the simpler MNIST Keras notebook. We first define a set of classes and functions and run the actual computation only in the very end."

    "### Step 1: Load and Process the SUSY Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The supersymmetry dataset can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning repository on [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00279/SUSY.csv.gz](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00279/SUSY.csv.gz). The dataset is quite large. Download the dataset and unzip it in a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading data in Pytroch is done by creating a user-defined a class, which we name `SUSY_Dataset`, and is a child of the `torch.utils.data.Dataset` class. This ensures that all necessary attributes required for the processing of the data during the training and test stages are easily inherited. The `__init__` method of our custom data class should contain the usual code for loading the data, which is problem-specific, and has been discussed for the SUSY data set in Notebook 5. More importantly, the user-defined data class must override the `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods of the parent `DataSet` class. The former returns the size of the data set, while the latter allows the user to access a particular data point from the set by specifying its index."

The `model` class initializes the types of layers needed for the deep neural net in its `__init__` method, while the DNN is assembled in a function method called `forward`, which accepts an `autograd.Variable` object and returns the output layer. Using this convention Pytorch will automatically recognize the structure of the DNN, and the `autograd` module will pull the gradients forward and backward using backprop.\n",

The second and third arguments are the `train_loader` and the `test_loader` objects, returned by the function `load_data()` we defined in Step 1 above.

As usual, we can choose any from a variety of different SGD-based optimizers, but we focus on the traditional SGD.\n",

We cast the data as pytorch `Variable`, re-set the `optimizer`, perform the forward step by calling the `DNN` model on the `data` and computing the `loss`. The backprop algorithm is then easily done using the `backward()` method of the loss function `criterion`. We use `optimizer.step` to update the weights of the `DNN`. Last print the performance for every minibatch. `train` returns the loss on the data.\n",

    "To study the performance of the model for a variety of different `data_set_sizes` and `learning_rates`, we do a grid search. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us define a function `grid_search`, which accepts the `args` variable containing all hyper-parameters needed for the problem. After choosing logarithmically-spaced `data_set_sizes` and `learning_rates`, we first loop over all `data_set_sizes`, update the `args` variable, and call the `load_data` function. We then loop once again over all `learning_rates`, update `args` and call `evaluate_model`."
